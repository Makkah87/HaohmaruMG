-----------------------------------------------------------------------
While travelling through a bamboo forest in feudal Japan, Haohmaru is pounced upon by five demonic warriors. Haoh draws his sword, and with great skill, manages to slay them all. Upon his victory, Haoh senses another demonic presence. He looks behind him, and discovers that Amakusa has been resurrected. Exhausted from his previous battle, Haoh charges bravely at the sorcerer. Amakusa quickly casts as a spell, which paralizes Haohmaru and causes him to be consumed by a giant vortex, which transports him to another dimension. While in this new world, he is approached by Suave Dude, the sponsor of the great M.U.G.E.N tournament. Suave, promises Haoh, that if he wins this tournament, he will transport him back to his own dimension, so that he may exact his revenge. Haohmaru graciously accepts his offer, and prepares himself mentally and physically, for the upcoming slaughter.

Notes
---------------
Haohmaru is slow, to say the very least. Try to keep the opponent, within range of your slashes, and combo where possible. Don't forget, about the new feature added to the Fake Senpuu Retsu Zan. If you find yourself conered, and being overwhelmed, that counter attack will come in handy.
